This is a repository of all of my configs broken down in to branches. 

I have a unique set of printers that are all currently running on Klipper. 

If you'd like, try any of my configs at your own risk. I am not responsible for any issues or mistakes or damage you cause to your machines by using these. 

all configs have ADXL tuning, pressure advance, and BL touches.
